# AI Security Gateway — Aura

**Aura** is an intelligent security gateway designed to protect Artificial Intelligence models from adversarial attacks. It acts as a critical inspection layer, analyzing input data in real-time to detect and neutralize threats before they can compromise an AI's integrity.

## 🧠 The Problem: A New Generation of Cyber Threats

Traditional security tools like firewalls and antivirus software are **blind** to a new, sophisticated threat vector — adversarial attacks on AI models.  
These attacks exploit subtle, often human-imperceptible manipulations to trick AI systems into making catastrophic errors.

Examples:
- A slightly altered image could cause a self-driving car to misinterpret a stop sign.  
- A modified audio clip could bypass a voice authentication system.

**Aura** is built to address this specific loophole, **protecting the mind of the AI, not just the network it lives on.**

## ⚡ Live Application Interface

Aura features a dynamic, hacker-themed dashboard that provides **real-time analysis and telemetry**.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🔹 Interactive UI
A professional, dark-themed interface designed for easy drag‑and‑drop file analysis.

### 🔹 Statistical Anomaly Detection
Aura’s **first line of defense**. It performs statistical analysis on incoming data to immediately flag and block low‑complexity attacks like random noise or malformed inputs.

### 🔹 Confidence Volatility Analysis (Core Innovation)
Aura’s **primary defense mechanism**. It probes the AI model’s stability by introducing minor _perturbations_ in the input data.

- **Benign Inputs:** Cause minimal change in the model’s confidence.
- **Adversarial Inputs:** Trigger erratic, unstable swings in prediction confidence.  
  Aura measures this volatility to detect sophisticated attacks that statistical analysis alone could miss.
